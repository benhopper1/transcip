        1. if user has app installed, then they would be redirected to open the app to specified screen
        2. if user doesn't have app installed, then their mobile browser wouldn't recognize the URL scheme
        and app wouldn't open since it's not installed. In 1 second (1000 milliseconds) user is redirected
        to download app from app store.
